Google VR SDK version : v1.60.0
Unity Version: 5.6.2f1
Name: VRScare
Things I Liked about this project: I had to do everything and show my creativity. 
Things that were difficult about this project: As I had to do everything, there were a lot of errors that I had to fix on my own.

The emotion that I would be depicting in this experience is fear.

The achievements that I am targeting in this VR project are as follows:

Fundamentals

Scale - 100 (In level 1, the person feels normal sized and in level 2 the person feels smaller than the zombie. In the movie section, the screen has been deliberately increased in size so that it looks like a movie theatre's screen.)
Animation - 100 (The zombie has two animations. One for walking and another for attacking.)
Lighting - 100 (Directional light of red color is used in level 1 and bluish color is used in level 2. The lighting is of baked type so that the FPS is according to the target platform.)
Locomotion - 100 (iTween and Waypoints have been implemented)
Video Player - 100(2x) (Movie screen is a video player)

Total=600

Completeness

Gamification - 250 (The player can play the game once and the time taken to complete the level is stored. If you beat your time, that time is stored. If you don't the earlier best time is displayed.)
Diegetic UI - 250 (The player is not told to find the key or open the door. It is implied.)
AI  - 250 (Zombie uses Unity NavMesh to move around the scene.)

Total=750

Challenges

User Test - 250 (2x) (Explained below.)

Total=500
